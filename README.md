# Healthcare Analytics Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of healthcare financial and patient data through two interactive dashboards: **Hospital Finance Dashboard** and **Hospital and Patients Dashboard**. These dashboards offer insights into financial performance, patient utilization, and operational metrics across hospitals, supporting data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To analyze hospital financial and patient data to support operational and financial planning.
- **Dataset:** Quarterly hospital financial and utilization data, including patient metrics, revenue data, and more.
- **Tools Used:** Excel, Tableau, Power BI, MySQL

## Data Source

The dataset includes quarterly reports from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), providing insights into various financial and utilization metrics such as:
- **Revenue Metrics:** Gross inpatient/outpatient revenue, net patient revenue, deductions from revenue.
- **Patient Metrics:** Licensed beds, staffed beds, patient days, discharges, outpatient visits.
- **Financial Metrics:** Operating expenses, capital expenditures, and adjustments.

## Key Analyses and Visualizations

### 1. Excel Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardized and cleaned data for consistency and completeness.
- **KPIs Calculated:** Created summary metrics such as occupancy rates, discharge rates, and net patient revenue.
- **Pivot Tables:** Segmented data by payer type, service category, and time period.
- **Data Summary:** Generated summarized tables for high-level insights into hospital operations and finances.

### 2. MySQL Database Management
- **Data Storage and Structuring:** Managed and structured the dataset in MySQL.
- **Key Queries:** 
  - Trends in patient discharges by payer type.
  - Analysis of revenue and expense distribution for financial planning.
  - Occupancy and patient turnover insights for operational efficiency.

### 3. Power BI Dashboards
- **Hospital Finance Dashboard:**
  - **Financial Performance:** Visuals on revenue sources, expense categories, and net operating margins.
  - **Revenue by Payer:** Breakdowns of gross and net patient revenue by payer category (Medicare, Medi-Cal, etc.).
  - **Expense Monitoring:** Analysis of total operating expenses with trends over time.
- **Hospital and Patients Dashboard:**
  - **Patient Utilization:** Visualizations on patient census days, bed occupancy rates, and outpatient visits.
  - **Discharges and Admissions:** Trends in patient discharges segmented by payer type and hospital services.
  - **Dynamic Filtering:** Filters for hospital type, time period, and patient demographics.

### 4. Tableau Visualizations
- **Trend Analysis:** Key metrics such as patient admissions, revenue, and expenses visualized over time.
- **Geographic Insights:** Mapped data to highlight trends and variations across counties.
- **KPI Visualization:** KPIs for discharge rates, outpatient visits, and financial metrics to support operational strategies.

## Results and Insights
- **Financial Insights:** Identification of primary revenue sources, cost drivers, and areas for improvement in financial management.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Utilization metrics provide insights for better resource allocation and patient care.
- **Payer Impact:** Disaggregated financial data by payer category shows the influence of different payer types on revenue and patient demographics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates effective use of data analytics tools to create actionable insights in healthcare management, supporting decisions in finance and patient operations.
